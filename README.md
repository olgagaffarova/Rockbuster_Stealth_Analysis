# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, Rockbuster Stealth is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.  

This project is a case study in which SQL was used to analyze Rockbuster’s business data and answer strategic questions that could guide the company’s move into online streaming.

## Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board posed a series of business questions and expected data-driven insights. The main questions explored in this project include:  

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?  
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?  
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?  
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?  
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
